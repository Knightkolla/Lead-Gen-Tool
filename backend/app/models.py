# No SQLAlchemy Base or declarative models needed for MongoDB.
# Data structure will be validated by Pydantic models in API routes.

# You might define a simple class here if you want a Python representation
# but it's not strictly necessary for basic MongoDB operations with FastAPI.

# Example (optional, for type hinting/structure representation):
# class Company:
#     def __init__(self, name: str, industry: str, location: str, **kwargs):
#         self.name = name
#         self.industry = industry
#         self.location = location
#         self.__dict__.update(kwargs)

# For data validation, Pydantic models (like those in search.py) are used.
